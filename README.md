# -CRACK-CURE-THE-SMART-SCREEN-THAT-HEALS-ITSELF-
This project is a mini software prototype inspired by a patent idea that demonstrates how a smartphone screen can self-heal from minor cracks using embedded microcapsules filled with liquid polymer. When the display gets damaged, the polymer automatically spreads and solidifies, restoring the screen's surface.
